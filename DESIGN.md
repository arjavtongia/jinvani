## Overview

**Creative North Star: "Inside the Mandir"**

Every screen after the opening darshan is the interior of a Digambar mandir: white Makrana marble underfoot, polished brass drawing the architecture, a carved cusped toran over the sanctum. Scripture stands in that sanctum under an arch, on the steps of a vedi; the day is read off a row of arched windows under the chhatra. Hierarchy comes from architecture (arch, plinth, niche, lintel, hairline), never from boxed cards or icon tiles.

The page is one calm centred column (42rem at most), dense enough for a daily habit but always leaving room around the verse. Day is veined white marble lit evenly; night is black Kota stone with the brass lit as if by the diya, warm and low-glare. Colour is spent sparingly: ink and marble carry the page, brass draws structure, sindoor marks what is sacred and the one action that matters on a screen.

Motion is ceremonial and brief. Entering a text draws the arch down from its kalash once; after that only the verse moves. Nothing loops, and reduced motion stills everything.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Cusped toran arches frame scripture, the continue-reading card, today's sutra and every picture.
- Brass is structure only: lines, lintels, plinth edges, rules, ornaments; never fills a panel.
- Sindoor is rare: the tithi, verse marks, parva flags, position markers and the primary action.
- Two carved-and-plain voices: Vesper Libre for what is read with reverence, Hind for the interface.
- rem everywhere: the six text sizes (root 17 to 31px, default 21px) scale the whole app.
- A veined-marble texture sits behind every screen, faint by day, fainter and inverted by night.

## Colors

A marble-and-brass palette with one devotional red, mirrored as black Kota stone with diya-lit brass at night.

### Primary
- **Sindoor** (day {colors.sindoor}, night text {colors.night-sindoor}, night fill {colors.night-sindoor-fill}): the vermilion of the tilak. Today's tithi, the ॥ verse label ॥ and verse-end marks, the dhwaja flag on parva days, the lozenge marking your place on a progress trail, the selected text-size dot, and the filled primary action (Continue, Listen). At night sindoor splits in two: a lighter tone for text and marks on the black stone, a deeper one for filled buttons so white text keeps its contrast.

### Secondary
- **Polished Brass** (#a8822c day, #c9a24f night) with its gradient stops **Brass Highlight**, **Brass Body** and **Brass Shadow**: the metal of the mandir. Arch and pillar lines (vertical gradient from highlight to shadow), the chhatra, kalash, plinth edges, tab lintel, rule lozenges, outlines of niches and pills.
- **Brass Script** (#7c5a14 day, #dcb965 night): brass dark or light enough to be read; the brand name, links, topics, meaning headings, icons inside buttons and niches.
- **Brass Line** and **Brass Wash** (translucent brass): hairline borders on pills and fields, and the faint gilt wash for hover, the continue arch, the today niche and the selected verse.

### Neutral
- **Makrana Marble** (#f4f2ed): the page.
- **Sanctum White** / **Niche White** (#faf9f6 / #fbfaf7): the inside of a shrine or niche, a step lighter than the page.
- **Plinth Marble** and **Plinth Edge** (#ebe7df / #dcd6ca): the vedi's steps and the bottom bars that stand on them.
- **Temple Ink** (#1f1c19) and **Verse Ink** (#1a1715): text; verse ink is a shade deeper.
- **Weathered Stone** (#5a544d): secondary text, inactive tabs.
- **Hairline** (13% ink): dividers between rows and under the top bar.
- **Kota Stone** (#161514) with **Kota Shrine** / **Kota Niche** (#1e1c1a / #26231f) and **Lamp Ivory** text (#efe9dd, verse #f4eee3): the night counterparts.
- **Scene Paper** / **Scene Ground** (#f7f4ee / #eadbbd; night #2a2622 / #3a3129): the sky and floor of the authored drawings, so pictures change with the theme.

### Named Rules
**The Brass Draws, Never Fills Rule.** Brass appears as line, edge, ornament or a translucent wash. It is never a solid panel background.

**The Sindoor Is Kept Rule.** Sindoor marks the sacred (tithi, verse marks, dhwaja) and position (the trail lozenge, the selected size); as a fill it is the primary action, at most one per screen, plus small numbered badges. Everything else is ink, stone or brass.

**The Two Sindoors Rule.** At night use the lighter sindoor for text and marks and the deeper fill behind white text; never swap them.

## Typography

**Display Font:** Vesper Libre 500/700/900 (with Noto Serif Devanagari, Kohinoor Devanagari, Nirmala UI, serif)
**Body Font:** Hind 400/600/700 (with system-ui and the platform's Devanagari sans faces)
**Splash Font:** Noto Serif Devanagari 400/600, used only by the opening darshan.

**Character:** Vesper Libre is carved, like an inscription on a temple pillar, and carries headings, the tithi and all scripture. Hind is the plain spoken voice of the interface, meanings and instructions, so explanation never reads as scripture.

All sizes are rem; the root is set by the text-size setting (17, 19, 21, 24, 27 or 31px; 21px default), so every value below grows with it.

### Hierarchy
- **Display** (Vesper 900, min(2.1rem, 11.5vw), 1.05): today's tithi in sindoor. One per app, on home, sized so the week and Continue reading share the first screen with it.
- **Greeting** (Vesper 900, 1.25rem, 1.15): जय जिनेन्द्र under the chhatra; 1.6rem on the welcome screen.
- **Headline** (Vesper 700, 1.42rem, 1.25): page titles, book titles, guide step titles.
- **Section** (Vesper 700, 1.22rem, 1.3): home section heads; continue-arch title at 1.3rem.
- **Title** (Vesper 700, 1.06rem, 1.3): h2, shelf heads, notices, feature titles; the shrine's ॥ label ॥ at 1rem in sindoor.
- **Verse** (Vesper 500, 1.13rem, 1.85, word-spacing 0.08em): scripture in the shrine, recited words, sutra of the day. Hanging indent of 1em per pada line in the shrine; centred and balanced in recite blocks.
- **Reading body** (Hind 400, 0.95rem, 1.75 to 1.8): meanings, glosses, stories, blurbs.
- **Body** (Hind 400/600, 0.86rem, 1.6): interface default; button labels at 600.
- **Label** (Hind 600, 0.76rem, 1.4): metadata, captions, day-note, size labels; 0.68rem for day niches, tab labels and the position line.

### Named Rules
**The Carved and Spoken Rule.** Scripture and headings are Vesper Libre; everything that explains or operates is Hind. Commentary sits below the verse in Hind with a brass hairline above it.

**The Numbers Are Latin Rule.** Numbers show in Latin digits with tabular figures in day niches, verse numbers and positions.

## Layout

One centred column, max 42rem, with a 1rem gutter; arches and shrines cap at 30rem (sutra 24rem, scene niche 26rem) and centre within it. The plinth under an arch is 1rem wider than the arch (31rem). Content is centred where it is ceremonial (greeting, tithi, shrine, recite blocks, morals) and left-aligned where it is operated (rows, settings, meanings).

Rhythm reuses 0.3, 0.6, 1, 1.4 and 2rem: 0.6rem between controls, 1.4rem between parts of a page (rules, figures, commentary), 2rem between shelves and major home sections. Rows are separated by hairlines, not gaps.

Tap targets are max(2.5rem, 48px), fixed at 48px under 640px so a large text size does not swell controls. Tabs and reader-bar buttons are at least 52px tall. The bottom bars are fixed, max 42rem, and the page reserves 6rem under them.

Responsive changes: at 560px stories become two columns; at 700px the story of the day sits beside its 22rem picture. The week of seven day niches scrolls horizontally if it must, with snap.

## Elevation & Depth

Depth is architectural, not floating. Surfaces step: page marble, a lighter sanctum inside arches and niches, and plinth marble for the steps and bars. Brass lines and stacked plinth bars give the sense of carved relief. Shadow is used in three places only.

### Shadow Vocabulary
- **Lift** (`box-shadow: 0 3px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.16)`, night 0.4): the primary sindoor button and the toast, the only things that sit proud of the marble.
- **Plinth ledge** (`box-shadow: 0 -3px 0 var(--plinth-edge), 0 -10px 22px rgba(0,0,0,0.07)`): the tab bar and reader bar; the solid 3px is the stone step's edge above the brass line, not a drop shadow.
- **Diya glow** (`radial-gradient(closest-side, var(--glow), transparent)` behind the shrine): at night always, and by day while listening.
- **Brass inset ring** (`box-shadow: inset 0 0 0 1px var(--brass)`): niche outlines and pressed or selected states.

### Named Rules
**The Stone Does Not Float Rule.** Cards, rows and niches never cast shadows; they are set into the marble by line and tone.

## Shapes

Three forms carry the world. The **cusped toran arch** is an SVG crown drawn in a 360-wide box springing at y = 80, with an even number of lobes so the apex is a cusp carrying a brass kalash finial; 12 lobes for the scripture shrine, 10 for continue-reading and scene niches, 8 for pictures and the sutra of the day. It is a double line (2.6 outer with the brass gradient, 0.9 inner at 75%) that continues down as stretched pillars to the height of the content. Pictures are 16:9 and seen through an 8-lobe arch mask with the same frame.

The **arch-topped niche** (jharokha) is a CSS shape: rounded elliptical top, nearly square foot. Emblem niches, day niches and chapter niches all use it at different proportions.

The **stepped plinth** is three bars of 62%, 78% and 94% width, each with a brass top edge and a marble gradient; a shrine stands on a full-width variant.

Everything operable is a pill (999px): buttons, chips, fields, the toast, verse-number badges. Small diagram boxes use 0.3rem, figures 0.4rem. Rules are 1px brass hairlines with a 0.42rem brass lozenge at the centre; lozenges (rotated squares) are the system's only point mark.

## Components

### Buttons
Quiet brass outlines with one sindoor voice.
- **Shape:** pill (999px), min height 48px, padding 0.4rem 1.15rem, Hind 600.
- **Primary:** sindoor fill, cream text, Lift shadow. One per screen: Continue on home, Listen in the reader bar.
- **Secondary:** transparent with a brass-line border, ink text, brass-script icon.
- **Hover / Focus:** border goes full brass and a brass wash fills; primary deepens to sindoor-hover. Press scales to 0.97. Focus is a 3px ink outline offset 3px.
- **Pressed toggle:** strong brass wash with an inset brass ring.
- **Icon button:** 48px circle, muted icon, brass wash on hover.

### Chips
- **Style:** pill outlines like secondary buttons, min height 46px, used for search suggestions; brass wash on hover.

### Cards / Containers
There are no cards. Containers are architectural:
- **Shrine:** the scripture's sanctum; 12-lobe crown, pillars, sanctum-white body, ॥ label ॥ in sindoor, verse below, attribution under the plinth.
- **Continue arch:** 10-lobe crown over a brass-wash body with title, place, progress trail and the primary button.
- **Scene niche:** 10-lobe crown and pillars around an authored drawing on scene paper, standing on a plinth, with a brass caption.
- **Arch picture:** 16:9 picture masked by an 8-lobe arch and framed in brass.

### Inputs / Fields
- **Style:** pill, niche-white field, brass-line border, Hind 500 at 0.95rem.
- **Focus:** border goes full brass plus a 3px ink outline. Listening by voice turns the border sindoor over a strong brass wash.
- **Error:** text in sindoor (day) or #f19a84 (night), weight 600.

### Navigation
- **Top bar:** sticky, page-coloured, hairline below; back link as a pill with a brass arrow.
- **Tab bar:** four tabs (home, books, search, settings) on plinth marble with a brass top edge and the plinth ledge. Inactive tabs are muted; the active tab is ink with a brass icon and a short brass lintel (1.7rem, gradient highlight to brass) hung from the bar's top edge.
- **Reader bar:** same plinth; Previous, Listen (sindoor primary, wider centre column), Next.
- **More below cue:** a quiet brass-script line in a band at the top of the bar, never over the words.

### Rows
Hairline-separated list rows at least 48px tall, an arch-topped emblem niche at left, title in Hind 600, subtitle muted, chevron at right; brass wash on hover. Verse-number badges are brass-outlined pills in Vesper.

### Week of Days
Seven arch-topped day niches: weekday label above, date in Vesper 700. Today is lit with a brass border and a brass wash fading downward; a selected day takes an inset brass ring; ashtami, chaturdashi and festivals carry a small sindoor dhwaja planted on the niche's arch.

### Ornaments
Chhatra (three-tier umbrella, the same drawing as the darshan) over the greeting, page heads and loading; on home it crowns the header between the name and the language button, and drops to a line of its own when large text leaves no room; dhwaja for parva days; brass rule with lozenge between home sections; progress trail as a hairline gilded to your place with a sindoor lozenge on it.

### Chitra (explanatory diagrams)
Lists, flows (brass chevrons between steps), stacks (brass wash deepening with depth), sums (outlined boxes and a Vesper operator), and trees (sindoor root, brass-topped branches); numbered sindoor badges mark steps. Each sits under a brass hairline with a Vesper title.

### Motion
- Screen entry: 0.22s rise of 0.5rem, ease-out-expo (`cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)`).
- Page turn: 0.24s slide of 1.4rem, verse and commentary only; the shrine stays still.
- Sanctum entry: arch lines draw down from the kalash (0.55s), kalash fades in (0.4s), pillars grow from the top (0.45s, delay 0.4s), verse rises (0.5s, delay 0.18s). Once per entry.
- State changes: 0.15s colour and border; toast 0.2s.
- `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` removes every transition and animation.

### Opening darshan (fixed brand asset)
The 3-second splash of Bhagwan Mahavir on a maroon-brown ground (#1c0d06), with its own palette, px sizing, Noto Serif Devanagari and timeline, is a confirmed owner asset outside this token system. Do not restyle it, and do not borrow its tracked uppercase name line or its colours for app screens. Its closing flare takes the app's page colour, which is its only link to the tokens.

### App icon (owner's choice)
The Jain Prateek (the emblem adopted by all Jain traditions in 1974: the loka outline holding the siddhashila and siddha, ratnatraya, the swastik with arms turning right, and the raised hand of ahimsa with a 24-spoked dharmachakra, thumb to the viewer's left) in sindoor #a3301a on marble #f4f2ed, with a soft white light behind it. Drawn in code by `tools/make_icons.py`; the maskable icon keeps the emblem inside Android's central 80% circle, and the iPhone icon is square for iOS to round. Keep the emblem's proportions (1.485 times as tall as it is wide) and its elements whole; never crop it, recolour it outside the sindoor and marble pair, or add the motto at icon sizes.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do:
- **Do** frame scripture, featured content and pictures in the cusped arch with an even lobe count, standing on a plinth.
- **Do** keep brass to lines, edges, ornaments and translucent washes, with the #brassV gradient on arch lines and the chhatra.
- **Do** keep one sindoor-filled action per screen and reserve sindoor text for the tithi, verse labels and verse marks.
- **Do** set scripture in Vesper Libre 500 at the verse size and its explanation in Hind below a brass hairline.
- **Do** size everything in rem so the six text sizes scale the whole screen, and keep tap targets at least 48px.
- **Do** give every colour a night value from the Kota stone set, and dim pictures at night as if lit by the diya.
- **Do** keep motion to one arch draw per entry and 150 to 250ms state changes, all still under reduced motion.

### Don't:
- **Don't** use boxed cards, icon tiles or a devotional dashboard grid; architecture makes the hierarchy.
- **Don't** fill a panel with solid brass or use sindoor for decoration.
- **Don't** put shadows on cards, rows or niches; only the primary button, toast and the bottom plinth carry them.
- **Don't** set commentary, meanings or instructions in Vesper Libre, or scripture in Hind.
- **Don't** add looping or decorative animation to app screens.
- **Don't** restyle the opening darshan or carry its splash colours, font or tracked uppercase line into the app.
