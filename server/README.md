# Ask server · प्रश्न पूछें

The app's **Ask** screen answers questions about Jain dharma in three steps, so that the AI model is
called as rarely as possible:

1. **Common questions** (`content/faq.json`, 56 questions in Hindi and English, each linked to its
   verse). They are answered on the phone, instantly and offline. No server, no cost.
2. **Answers already given**, kept on the phone and in this server's shared cache (Workers KV,
   90 days). A question asked once, by anyone, in the same or similar words, is never sent to the
   model again.
3. **New questions** go to NVIDIA's model (`nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b`), which answers only
   from passages of the app's own texts, found in the search index (`ask-index/`, built by
   `tools/build_ask_index.js`), and cites them. The app links each citation to the verse.

Until this server is deployed, the app answers the common questions only.

## Files

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `worker.js` | The server (a Cloudflare Worker): cache, limits, CORS |
| `retrieve.js` | Finds the best passages for a question in the index |
| `answer.js` | The instructions to the model and the call to NVIDIA |
| `wrangler.toml` | Cloudflare settings: model, index address, allowed origins, cache |
| `../js/askkey.js` | Word matching shared by the app, the server and the index builder |
| `../tools/build_ask_index.js` | Builds `ask-index/` and links the common questions to verses |
| `../tools/test_ask.mjs` | Tries questions from the command line |
| `../tools/serve_ask.mjs` | Runs this server on your computer for testing |

## Deploy (about 15 minutes, once)

You need a free [Cloudflare](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up) account, your NVIDIA API key
(from [build.nvidia.com](https://build.nvidia.com)), and Node.js.

```
cd server
npx wrangler login
npx wrangler kv namespace create ASK_CACHE
```

Paste the `id` it prints into `wrangler.toml` (replacing `PASTE_THE_KV_ID_HERE`), then:

```
npx wrangler secret put NVIDIA_API_KEY
npx wrangler deploy
```

`deploy` prints the server's address, like `https://swadhyay-ask.<you>.workers.dev`. Put it in
`js/ask.js`:

```js
const SERVER = 'https://swadhyay-ask.<you>.workers.dev';
```

Commit and push; the Ask screen now answers new questions too. Check it at
`https://swadhyay-ask.<you>.workers.dev/health`.

## Keeping it up to date

- **After adding or editing texts, or the common questions:** run `node tools/build_ask_index.js`
  and commit `ask-index/` and `content/faq.json`.
- **To add a common question:** add an entry to `content/faq.json` (`q`, `also` for other wordings,
  `a`, and `sources` with the book id and a few words of the verse in `find`), then rebuild as above.
  The most asked questions are worth adding: they are then free and work offline.
- **To see what people ask:** in the Cloudflare dashboard, Workers KV → ASK_CACHE lists every
  question answered by the model, with its answer.
- **To change the model:** edit `MODEL` in `wrangler.toml` and run `npx wrangler deploy`. Try a model
  first with `MODEL=... node tools/test_ask.mjs "your question"`.

## Limits and cost

- Each visitor can ask 20 new questions an hour; cached and common questions are not counted.
- Questions are limited to 300 characters, and only the app's site may call the server
  (`ALLOWED_ORIGINS`).
- Cloudflare's free plan allows 100,000 requests a day and 1,000 new cached answers a day. If the
  server ever reports exceeding its CPU time, the $5 a month Workers plan removes that limit.
- NVIDIA's hosted API comes with free credits for development; check build.nvidia.com for the terms
  for an app used by the public, and for paid use.

## Privacy

Questions are sent to the server and to NVIDIA to be answered, and stored with their answer in the
cache for 90 days, without any name, address or identifier.
